# Database

</div>

The Convex database provides a relational data model, stores JSON-like
documents, and can be used with or without a schema. It \"just works,\"
giving you predictable query performance in an easy-to-use interface.

Query and mutation functions read and write data through a lightweight
JavaScript API. There is nothing to set up, and no need to write any
SQL. Just use JavaScript to express your app\'s needs.

Start by learning about the basics of Tables & Documents, Reading Data
and Writing Data.

As your app grows more complex you\'ll need more from your database:

-   Relational data modeling with Document IDs
-   Fast querying with Indexes
-   Exposing large datasets with Paginated Queries
-   Type safety by Defining a Schema
-   Interoperability with data Import & Export
