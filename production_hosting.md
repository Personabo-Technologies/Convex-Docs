# Hosting and Deployment

</div>

The easiest way to publish your Convex app to the internet is to use a
hosting provider like Vercel or Netlify.

Both Netlify and Vercel integrate with git to deploy code whenever a new
revision is pushed. To host your app:

1.  Commit all files and push to your favorite git hosting provider such
    as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.

    -   Note that your repository *needs to include* the `convex.json`
        file. If you don\'t have one, you can create a new Convex
        project with `npx convex init` or recreate an old one with
        `npx convex reinit`.

2.  Follow the appropriate guide below.

If you aren\'t using Netlify or Vercel, a similar process should work
for other providers and deployment workflows.
